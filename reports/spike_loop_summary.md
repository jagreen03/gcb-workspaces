# Spike Loop Summary — autonomous backlog-clearing run

Started 2026-09-12, session `01Rpa9VJGe7xypzp5FkukSco`. Append one dated
section per loop iteration below this line; never edit a prior iteration's
entry (the program's own convention — correct forward, don't rewrite
history). Epistemic labels are preserved exactly as used in the ticket
files themselves; this report does not re-grade anything.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-09-12

**Target selected:** `TKT-020` Y1 ("zero CDC scaffolding... no SDC exists
anywhere"), specifically verifying and then acting on whether `TKT-018`
actually closed Y1 items 1/2/4 as a prior recommendation in `TKT-020`
itself claimed it would.

**Pre-check (not skipped):** confirmed `TKT-020` R2 is already closed
(`gcb-wdm-transceiver@5cba81b`, `gcb-workspaces@1023cd8`, `result_fault`
present and live in `gcb_rx_digital_recombiner.sv`) before starting, so
this iteration did not re-execute it.

**Finding:** the "TKT-018 gate... (closes Y1 items 1/2/4)" line in
`TKT-020`'s own "Recommended gate tickets" section was a pre-`TKT-018`
*recommendation*, not a retrospective closure claim, and `TKT-018` as
actually executed did not fulfill it in full. Verified directly: `find .
-iname "*.sdc" -o -iname "*.xdc"` returned **zero files** anywhere in
`gcb-wdm-transceiver` before this iteration. Item 2 (`gcb_max_reduce`
`REG_STAGES`) genuinely was closed, by `GCB-031`/`.032`'s real physical
validation (`WNS 0.00 ps`, `fmax 1.519 GHz`) — not by `TKT-018`'s own
framing of item 3 specifically, but the underlying work exists and counts.
Items 1 and 4 were not closed.

**Work done:**
1. `gcb_dwdm_async_skew_fifo.sv` — marked all six 2-flop CDC synchronizer
   register pairs (gray-code pointer crossings + `TKT-019.21`'s
   cross-coupled reset tree) `(* ASYNC_REG = "TRUE" *) (* keep = "true" *)`.
   Verified the attributes survive `sv2v` (the real Yosys-path frontend)
   per-declaration, not merely that Verilator accepts the syntax.
2. `constraints/gcb_dwdm_async_skew_fifo_cdc.tcl` (new) — the first
   `.sdc`/constraint artifact of any kind in `gcb-wdm-transceiver`: a
   sourceable `set_clock_groups -asynchronous` procedure for the
   `wr_clk`/`rd_clk` boundary, documented as a per-lane-callable template
   (this module owns no fixed clock names of its own — `gcb_dwdm_deskew_cdc`
   instantiates `NUM_COLORS` copies, each with its own `wr_clk`).
3. `backlog/TKT-020-red-yellow-audit.md` — appended a dated disposition
   note correcting the overstated closure claim, documenting exactly what
   was and wasn't closed, with the evidence above.
4. `backlog/TKT-029-sram-geometry-and-fullscale-synth-hardening.md` (new) —
   a fully actionable ticket for Y1's genuine remainder: item 3
   (power-of-two SRAM address-math guard), item 5 (`SRAM_LATENCY`/`RD_REG`
   consistency check), item 4 (full-default-geometry Yosys run — a
   measurement task, explicitly not graded per the `TKT-019.9` precedent).
   Each has its own acceptance criteria and is independently actionable.
5. `README.md` (gcb-workspaces) — updated `TKT-020`'s summary line with the
   disposition finding, added `TKT-029`'s filetree entry and table row.

**Test results (actual, not assumed):** the RTL change is
synthesis-attribute-only (zero behavioral change), confirmed rather than
merely expected:
- `sim/lint.sh`: **38/38 clean**
- `test_wdm_deskew_cdc.py`: **TESTS=10 PASS=10 FAIL=0**
- `test_wdm_link_integration.py`: **TESTS=22 PASS=22 FAIL=0**
- `test_wdm_payload_mux.py`: **TESTS=3 PASS=3 FAIL=0**

**Epistemic status:** the CDC attribute/constraint addition is
**PROVEN — DIGITAL SIMULATION, TESTED CONDITIONS** for "introduces zero
behavioral regression" (regression-confirmed). It is explicitly **NOT** a
claim that the synchronizer's physical MTBF/latency assumptions
(`TKT-019.3`'s own `MAX_SKEW_CYCLES` placeholder) are validated, nor that
any real synthesis tool's specific retiming behavior was tested end-to-end
— only that the attribute and constraint now exist and correctly express
intent to whichever tool reads them. Item 1's remainder (GDDR7 PHY / optical
SerDes domains) stays **OPEN DEFECT** — no RTL exists yet to constrain.
`TKT-029`'s three items are **UNPROVEN / not yet attempted** — ticket
creation only this iteration, no execution.

**Commits:**

- `gcb-wdm-transceiver`: `f36e460`
- `gcb-workspaces`: PENDING (this file + TKT-020/TKT-029/README land in the
  same commit that records this hash — see the commit that touches this
  file for the actual hash; written before that commit exists)

**Ticket status changes:** `TKT-020` — still `open | pending` overall (an
audit deliverable, per its own Objective), disposition note appended.
`TKT-029` — created, `open | pending`.

**Next candidate for iteration 2:** `TKT-029` item 3 or item 5 (both are
small, bounded, elaboration-time guards — good next single-iteration
targets), or `TKT-020` R3 (Cyclopter scavenger validation — lower priority,
software/data-pipeline tier, not silicon/RTL).
